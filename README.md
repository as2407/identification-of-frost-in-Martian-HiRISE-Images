# Identification of Frost in Martian HiRISE Images


Developed a **CNN** model using **Keras** and **Python** to accurately identify frost in Martian terrain images from **HiRISE** data collected between November and December 2023. Implemented advanced image augmentation techniques for robust training and applied transfer learning with **EfficientNetBO** and **ResNet50** and **VGG16**, optimizing final layers for Martian image, and validated the model's effectiveness through **precision**, **recall**, and **F1** **score** metrics, demonstrating its reliability in diverse terrain classification.
